        <p>This phase is know as translation because there is a language change between the language of nucleotides (4 base
            pairs = a 4 character alphabet) and the language of proteins (20 amino acids = a 20 character alphabet). The
            genetic code is a triplet code. A sequence of 3 nucleotide base pairs (know as a codon) codes for 1 amino acid.</p>
